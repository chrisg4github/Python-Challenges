    "# ride service is convenient and cost effective.  On the other side of usage of the ride service, \n",
    "# people in rural and suburban environments live there to not be in an non-urban environment, and \n",
    "# since public transportation services are limited to non-existent, inconvenient, and expensive \n",
    "# outside of cities, these people would be mostly self-sufficient in the transportation environment.  \n",
    "# Drawing on my experience and knowledge, people in rural and suburban areas would use ride \n",
    "# services in special situations like going to the airport where you might not want to leave your \n",
    "# car, and since services that older people use are in urban areas they would tend to use a ride \n",
    "# service to get to those services.  And the difference between suburban and rural usage could be \n",
    "# related to how close one group is to a city and usage of urban service and thus the Pyber ride \n",
    "# service.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2)Cost surprised me a little.  I would have thought that urban users would do more shorter trips \n",
    "# resulting in more rides and more at a lower cost.  Not sure what is going on with the data here, \n",
    "# but I would look further into why that is.  I don't use a Pyber type ride service, so I don't \n",
